# ML-Invasive-Species
A machine learning approach in understanding the spread of invasive species from anthopogenic factors

In this R script we:
-  generate a dataset taken from the ddbtaxon list
- create a machine learning model to predict the movement of invasive species in accordance with specific variables
- future use: implement evidence based policy to reduce the effects some variables are having in the spread of invasive species
